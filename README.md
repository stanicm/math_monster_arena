# Math Monster Arena

A Space Invaders-style math game where you fly a creature through space, solve math problems, and evolve into increasingly powerful forms.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS — no dependencies, no build step.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. That's it.

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrow Keys / WASD | Move your creature |
| Space | Shoot beams |
| Escape | Pause / Resume |

### Gameplay

- Math problems appear at the top of the screen.
- **Levels 1-4:** addition and subtraction.
- **Level 5+:** multiplication is added to the mix.
- **Level 10+:** division joins in (integer results only).
- All answers stay within 0-100.
- Answer bubbles fall from above — shoot the **correct answer** to earn XP.
- Avoid **asteroids** and **wrong answers** — they cost you health.
- Answer **10 questions** to level up. Difficulty scales with your level.

### Creature Evolution

As you level up, your creature evolves through 5 stages:

1. **Hatchling** — where every math monster begins
2. **Sparky** — gaining energy and confidence
3. **Blazer** — fire-powered and fast
4. **Stormclaw** — lightning strikes twice
5. **Legendragon** — the ultimate math beast

Your weapon also upgrades through 5 tiers as you progress.
